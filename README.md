# LeetCode Solutions in Rust

This repository contains my solutions to various problems on LeetCode in Rust, with the purpose of learning and improving my Rust skills. Each solution is contained in a separate file in the src/solutions directory, named sxxxx.rs where xxxx is the problem number.

## Usage

To run the tests for a specific problem, use the command cargo test solutions::sxxxx::test, where xxxx is the problem number. For example, to run the tests for problem 1, use cargo test solutions::s0001::test.

## Problems solved

The following is a list of problems that have been solved, along with the corresponding file names in the src/solutions directory:
