# LeetCode Solutions in Rust
This repository contains my solutions to various problems on LeetCode in Rust, with the purpose of learning and improving my Rust skills. Each solution is contained in a separate file in the src directory, named sxxxx.rs where xxxx is the problem number.

## Usage
To run the tests for a specific problem, use the command cargo test sxxxx::test, where xxxx is the problem number. For example, to run the tests for problem 1, use cargo test s0001::test.
